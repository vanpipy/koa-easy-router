# Koa easy router
It is only an explannation router for koa, the important point to explain how the router does work.

# Basic
This router base on [http.createServer](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v7.x/docs/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_requestlistener), the dispatcher will filter each request and run the function matched.

# TODO
+ Fill the correct and better struct to router.
+ Maybe es6 completed support needed.
